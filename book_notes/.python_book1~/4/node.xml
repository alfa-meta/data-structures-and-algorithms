Theory Based Questions:
1.  What is a Data Structure? Data Structure is an organization of data into complex types.
2. Define data type and differentiate between primary and secondary data types? 
	a. Data type - a specific implementation of storing data of that specific organisation.
	b. Primary data types refer to primitive types such as int, char, bool. And Secondary data types refer to data structures, classes, enums.
3. What are Linear and non-linear data structures? Linear data structures are in sequential order leading from one data point to the other. Whilst non-linear data structures use hierarchical or networked manner of arranging data.
4. Define Stack and give any two applications of Stacks?
	a. Stack is a data structure that follows First in Last out or Last in First Out principle of storing data.
	b. Stacks are useful for recursion as well as evaluating types of expressions.
5. Define Queue ad give any two applications of Queues?
	a. Queue is a linear data structure that uses First in First Out principle.
	b. Queues are used in implementing scheduling algorithms.
6. Define Trees and give any two applications of Trees?
	a. 
	b.
7. Define Graph and give any two applications of Graphs?
	a.
	b.
8. How willd you sort a list of numbers without spending time? 
9.  Explain PAPP? Problem Algorithm Program Process is a methodology of understanding Data Structures and Algorithms.
10. I need to study DSA because without it: A. my algorithms will be weak. B. I will have less understanding of the programs I write. C. I will struggle getting a job.</rich_text>
